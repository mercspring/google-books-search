![sample gif](./sample.gif)

## Description
This is a google books search application that allows users to search for books using the google books api and saved results that they find. 

## Usage
To use, go the to search page (same as the landing page) and type the book or authors name into the search bar and click `Search`. The top 10 results from google books will show up with thumbnails, titles, author names, and a description of the book. You can then click the `Save` and `View` buttons to save the book to your favorites or view the books informational page on google books.  
You can then click on the `Saved` link in the nav bar to view your favorites and from there you can click on the `View` button to view the informational page on google books or the `Delete` button to remove the book from your favorites.

## Technologies 
This is a full stack application utilizing the MERN stack. React is used on the front-end along side the excellent ARWES library for styling and axios for api requests. The back-end uses express as it's server and Mongdb with mongoose for it's database.
